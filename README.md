Modifications for Voron
1.55 Machines

Those
changes were made to try to reduce costs, maintaining quality and improving
all-round stiffness  in the frame and gantry.

All
files are modified from MZBot / RussiancCatFood original files(https://github.com/mzbotreprap/VORON) and Volcom8190 Voron Mods (https://github.com/mzbotreprap/VORON/tree/master/Mods/Volcom8190) adapted for 3030 aluminum profile,12mm Chinisium
polymer bearings,  12mm Gantry  (XY) and 8mm Z.

Note:
12mm chinisium  polymer bushings
dimensions (L30mm, OD21mm, ID12mm – OD is
smaller then the original igus bushings)

The use of 12mm  aluminum hollow tubes ( extrusion ) is
advised to prevent binding.

Some
parts are intended for 300x300mm print area : (bitolas – (gauges) files for the
alignment  of the Z vertical rods in the
all metal version.)

These
files allow the following: 

Full
metal Z supports( with alignment stl’s available) , and/or full metal bed frame
with a bed plate design available.

 12mm were its most needed (xy). A revised
carriage adapted for 12mm chinese “igus”, e3d V6 and bltouch from volcom8190
carriage files.

Full
metal Z suports with the use of Steel 8mm SK8 Linear Bearing Rail Shaft Guide Support
Bracket ( aligned with the “ bitolas “ files ). An extra extrusion needs
to be added to the frame were this will attach. This also adds improved stiffness
to the frame.

Design for a full metal bed frame, supported vertically
by LMF8LUU bearings attached to the bed frame.
